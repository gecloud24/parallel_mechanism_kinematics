# parallel_mechanism_kinematics

1-This algorithm is designed for the kinematics anlysis of parellel mechanism which includes forward and inverse kinematics;

2-Hexapod stewart mechanism is applied as the parellel mechanism;

3-Genetic algorithm is adopted for the forward kinematics analysis;

4-You could calculate results and plot the status of the hexapod stewart mechanism

5-The language is Matlab;
